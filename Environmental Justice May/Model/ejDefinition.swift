let ejDef = " \"Environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. \n \n This goal will be achieved when everyone enjoys: \n \n • The same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards, and \n • Equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.\" \n \n - U.S. EPA"
